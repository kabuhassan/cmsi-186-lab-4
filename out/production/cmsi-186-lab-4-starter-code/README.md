# CMSI 186 Lab 4 Robot Soccer Starter Code

This repository contains an unfinished Java program for you to complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/4/).

In your new repository, don’t forget to completely edit this README file, as _your_ repository will not contain “an unfinished Java program.” Consider adding a fun image, but not _too_ fun, as your GitHub repository will be checked by prospective employers.
